# KiCad-Stensils
A utility script to create the archive of Gerber files ready for uploading to OSH Stensils

As of KiCAD 5.0, the scripting menu is only available to the nightly builds and not the stable release. So this script can only be ran from the Tools->Scripting Console window and execute the following command. Note the exact path to the script file is required.

execfile('/path/to/script/file/oshstencil.py')
